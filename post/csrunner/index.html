<p>This challenge is a game, according to its description. Since I gave up on the challenge I was trying to do (NOdeBANKing), I went to help other teammates blocked on this challenge.</p>
<p>This game was using Unity3D as engine, where game logic is usually written in C# or other language that compiles to MSIL. So let&rsquo;s find the GameAssembly.dll, but no luck it&rsquo;s a native DLL and not a managed one&hellip; After opening it in IDA Free, I noticed &ldquo;il2cpp_&rdquo; references, and after some googling, figured out it was a tool that compile MSIL code to native x86 code.</p>
<p>I first thought that the game &ldquo;logic&rdquo; could actually be embedded in resources (the &ldquo;data.unity3d&rdquo; file in CSRunner_Data), but I failed to find a tool able to open the new UnityFS format, all I got was weird lz4 invalid stream issues coming from nowhere.</p>
<p>So, I looked for a tool able to reconstruct metadata of the &ldquo;original&rdquo; assembly, and finally came across <a href="https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper">Il2CppDumper</a>, which even comes with an IDAPython script to rename funcs and add types in IDA Pro. I used that tool to generate &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; assemblies that could be opened in dnSpy, even if there was no MSIL code in the assemblies, but it&rsquo;s a good starting point to understand the class structure.</p>
<p>And the tool also comes with IDAPython scripts to rename il2cpp-converted functions, which I could use since I managed to compile IDAPython and make it run on my IDA Free 7.6. I first explored Game methods, which only seemed to print debug messages stuff even if <code>PickupHit</code> and <code>PickupMiss</code> methods looked promising.</p>
<p>But there was another class with interesting name, <code>DieOnCollision</code>, which seemed to handle collisions, I looked at the <code>DieOnCollision$$OnCollisionEnter</code> and saw this:</p>

        <span style="color:#ff79c6">goto</span> LABEL_50;
        }
    }
</code></pre></div><p>So I just had to force the <code>if ( System_String__op_Equality(tag, StringLiteral_4306, 0i64) )</code> condition to be always false (patching the <code>jz      loc_1806E612D</code> at <code>0x1806e6078</code> to a jmp), and colliding with enemies would do nothing.</p>
<p>Then I gave the modified assembly to our team&rsquo;s pro gamer (since I run Linux, and couldn&rsquo;t manage to get the tool mentioned before on <code>GameAssembly.so</code> of the Linux version), which was able to get the flag in two game tries.</p>
