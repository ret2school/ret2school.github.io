 mailman is a heap challenge I did for the ImaginaryCTF 2023 event. It was a basic heap challenge involving tcache poisoning, safe-linking and seccomp bypass.</description>

 Write me a book is a heap challenge I did during the Grey Cat The Flag 2023 Qualifiers. You can find the tasks and the exploit here.
TL;DR To manage to read the flag we have to:
 create overlapping chunks due to an oob write vulnerability in rewrite_books tcache poisoning thanks to the overlapping chunks Overwrite the first entry of @books to then be able to rewrite 4 entries of @books by setting a large size.</description>

Heap exploitation is cool, and the best is when no free is used. &amp;gt;Try to pwn the challenge and get the flag remotely.
Note:
 You must spawn an instance to solve this challenge. You can connect to it with netcat: nc IP PORT  Author: Express#8049

      <description>Introduction zigzag is a zig heap challenge I did during the corCTF 2022 event. It was pretty exotic given we have to pwn a heap like challenge written in zig. It is not using the C allocator but instead it uses the GeneralPurposeAllocator, which makes the challenge even more interesting. Find the tasks here.
TL; DR  Understanding zig GeneralPurposeAllocator internals Hiijack the BucketHeader of a given bucket to get a write what were / read what where primitive.</description>

      <description>Introduction cshell2 is a heap challenge I did during the corCTF 2022 event. It was pretty classic so I will not describe a lot. If you begin with heap challenges, I advice you to read previous heap writeup.
TL; DR  Fill tcache. Heap overflow in edit on the bio field which allows to leak the address of the unsortedbin. Leak heap and defeat safe-linking to get an arbitrary write through tcache poisoning.</description>

      <description>Introduction  I just learned how to use malloc and free&amp;hellip; am I doing this right?
 catastrophe is a heap challenge I did during the diceCTF 2022. I did have a lot of issues with the libc and the dynamic linker, thus I did a first time the challenge with the libc that was in /lib/libc.so.6, then I figured out thanks to my teammate supersnail that I was using the wrong libc.</description>

      <description>Intro phonebook is a basic heap challenge I did during the dctf event. It&amp;rsquo;s basically just a heap overflow wich allows us to overflow a function pointer with for example the address of system.
The bug $ ./phonebook Choose an option: [1-5] 1. Store someone&#39;s information 2. Edit information 3. Call someone 4. Unfriend someone 5. Add the hidden_note &amp;gt; We can create an entity and then initialize: a name, a numero and a function pointer.</description>

      <description>Hello folks ! Here is a write up for the two first pwn challenges of the ASIS CTF. You can find the related files here.
justpwnit justpwnit was a warmup pwn challenge. That&amp;rsquo;s only a basic stack overflow. The binary is statically linked and here is the checksec&amp;rsquo;s output:
[*] &#39;/home/nasm/justpwnit&#39; Arch: amd64-64-little RELRO: Partial RELRO Stack: No canary found NX: NX enabled PIE: No PIE (0x400000) Morever the source code is provided as it is the case for all the pwn tasks !</description>

      <guid>https://ret2school.github.io/post/ductf_note/</guid>
      <description>DownUnderCTF - DUCTFnote (471 points) DUCTFnote was a heap exploitation challenge.
The main difficulty was that we could only have one active note at a time, so if we create a new note, the old one is no longer accessible.
Source code analysis I spotted one bug in the source code which leads to another bug :
135 void edit_note(datanote_t * note) { 136 if(!note) { 137 printf(&amp;#34;No Note.\n&amp;#34;); 138 return; 139 } 140 141 signed char idx = 0; 142 while(idx &amp;lt;= note-&amp;gt;size) { // note-&amp;gt;size can takes values from 0 to 127 (0x7f) 143 *(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) = fgetc(stdin); 144 if (*(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) == &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;) {*(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) = &amp;#39;\0&amp;#39;; break;} 145 idx++; 146 } 147 } In the function edit_note the condition of the while is incorrect and the loop is executed once too often : while(idx &amp;lt;= note-&amp;gt;size) should have been while(idx &amp;lt; note-&amp;gt;size).</description>

      <description>Cheapie (pwn - 198 pts)  Êtes-vous familier avec le tas ?
 Yay a heap challenge !
Setup The given libc didn&amp;rsquo;t have any symbols and no loader was provided, so I ran pwninit to retrieve a libc with symbols and a loader. Which I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise until me writing this, is that pwninit gave me a different libc, that changed the final part of the exploit : getting a shell !</description>

      <description>Da Vinci CTF 2021 - Quotebook (499 pts) The subject of this task was:
 I created this amazing service to store all my famous quotes. Can you get the flag?
nc challs.dvc.tf 2222
 We are given the binary, the source code for it and the libc used on the server. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to find a vuln into the binary to get a shell and grab a flag from the server (typical pwn task).</description>
