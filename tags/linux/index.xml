      <description>UTCTF 2023: Welcome  Welcome
1000
Note: while this challenge is nominally RE, there is some crypto-level/crypto-style math involved too.
Welcome to UTCTF! I made a special last minute program just for you to display a wonderful welcome message (+ flag!) I may have accidentally (okay&amp;hellip; purposely) made a small bug in my math &amp;gt; that makes this unsolvable(TM). Can you figure it out and fix it for me please?</description>

      <title>[SECCON CTF 2022 Quals] babyfile</title>

      <description>Introduction babyfile is a file stream exploitation I did during the SECCON CTF 2022 Quals event. I didn’t succeed to flag it within the 24 hours :(. But anyway I hope this write up will be interesting to read given I show another way to gain code execution &amp;ndash; I have not seen before &amp;ndash; based on _IO_obstack_jumps! The related files can be found here. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with file stream internals, I advice you to read my previous writeups about file stream exploitation, especially this one and this other one.</description>
