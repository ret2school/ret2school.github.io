 window-of-opportunity is a kernel exploitation challenge I did for the ImaginaryCTF 2023. We are given an arbitrary read primitive (and a stack buffer overflow but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it), and the goal is basically to read the /flag.txt file.</description>

 Write me a book is a heap challenge I did during the Grey Cat The Flag 2023 Qualifiers. You can find the tasks and the exploit here.
TL;DR To manage to read the flag we have to:
 create overlapping chunks due to an oob write vulnerability in rewrite_books tcache poisoning thanks to the overlapping chunks Overwrite the first entry of @books to then be able to rewrite 4 entries of @books by setting a large size.</description>

      <description>Introduction zigzag is a zig heap challenge I did during the corCTF 2022 event. It was pretty exotic given we have to pwn a heap like challenge written in zig. It is not using the C allocator but instead it uses the GeneralPurposeAllocator, which makes the challenge even more interesting. Find the tasks here.
TL; DR  Understanding zig GeneralPurposeAllocator internals Hiijack the BucketHeader of a given bucket to get a write what were / read what where primitive.</description>

      <description>Introduction cshell2 is a heap challenge I did during the corCTF 2022 event. It was pretty classic so I will not describe a lot. If you begin with heap challenges, I advice you to read previous heap writeup.
TL; DR  Fill tcache. Heap overflow in edit on the bio field which allows to leak the address of the unsortedbin. Leak heap and defeat safe-linking to get an arbitrary write through tcache poisoning.</description>

 catastrophe is a heap challenge I did during the diceCTF 2022. I did have a lot of issues with the libc and the dynamic linker, thus I did a first time the challenge with the libc that was in /lib/libc.so.6, then I figured out thanks to my teammate supersnail that I was using the wrong libc.</description>

      <description>DownUnderCTF - DUCTFnote (471 points) DUCTFnote was a heap exploitation challenge.
The main difficulty was that we could only have one active note at a time, so if we create a new note, the old one is no longer accessible.
Source code analysis I spotted one bug in the source code which leads to another bug :
135 void edit_note(datanote_t * note) { 136 if(!note) { 137 printf(&amp;#34;No Note.\n&amp;#34;); 138 return; 139 } 140 141 signed char idx = 0; 142 while(idx &amp;lt;= note-&amp;gt;size) { // note-&amp;gt;size can takes values from 0 to 127 (0x7f) 143 *(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) = fgetc(stdin); 144 if (*(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) == &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;) {*(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) = &amp;#39;\0&amp;#39;; break;} 145 idx++; 146 } 147 } In the function edit_note the condition of the while is incorrect and the loop is executed once too often : while(idx &amp;lt;= note-&amp;gt;size) should have been while(idx &amp;lt; note-&amp;gt;size).</description>

 Yay a heap challenge !
Setup The given libc didn&amp;rsquo;t have any symbols and no loader was provided, so I ran pwninit to retrieve a libc with symbols and a loader. Which I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise until me writing this, is that pwninit gave me a different libc, that changed the final part of the exploit : getting a shell !</description>
