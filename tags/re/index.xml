      <description>Aero CTF 2021 - BashD00r (500 pts) This is the second challenge I was able to solve, and the hardest one. The task is below:
 There seems to be something wrong with our bash.
Can you see if anyone has entered the backdoor?
bash.7z
 So we are given a archive, which contains a &amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; binary. This binary was backdoored, so we need to find it to get the flag.</description>

      <description>Aero CTF 2021 - Dummyper (454 pts) This the first challenge I did. The challenge&amp;rsquo;s task was:
 This stupid program has encrypted our flag.
We only have a dump left.
 With a mysterious &amp;ldquo;dump.7z&amp;rdquo; that contains a &amp;ldquo;dump&amp;rdquo; file. This file is an ELF binary, so we load it in IDA.
Overview IDA complains about broken section table, but still succeeds to load the bin. We get classical glibc&amp;rsquo;s __libc_start_main, and the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; function which looks like this:</description>

      <description>UnionCTF - Unionware This challenge gives us two files: an &amp;ldquo;unionware.ps1&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;important_homework.txt.unionware&amp;rdquo; containing seemingly random bytes. The challenge tells us that a ransomware encrypted the important homework and asks us to decrypt it.
Analyzing the Powershell While looking at the powershell, we can see an obfuscated Powershell command, which seems to split some random string and then evaluating it. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll just run the part of the script which deobfuscates the payload without executing it, which give us:</description>

      <description>Hello world,
This writeup concerns the most difficult challenge I did on the CTF (having occupied myself a few hours to break it). At first glance, we have an &amp;ldquo;obfuscated&amp;rdquo; binary, which makes system calls to mmap and mprotect: we immediately think of a packer, and we will therefore have to unpack it.
Unpacking crackme Unpacking is not a problem on Linux when you are used to malware packers on Windows, thanks to radare2 and its visual mode.</description>

Files can be found here
For this challenge, we get an archive with a lot of files, the name of which seems to be a hash. Each file is an ELF x86_64 program file. In addition, a server listens, and requests:
Enter valid token to binary with name &amp;lt;8c235f89a8143a28a1d6067e959dd858&amp;gt; Token: at connection. We therefore understand quickly enough that we will have to automate the reversing of all these ELFs to send the correct token back to the server, and thus have the flag, the server requesting a series of tokens before spitting the flag.</description>

For this challenge, I first noticed (like in every other writeups) a big structure of offsets, that pointed to &amp;ldquo;funclets&amp;rdquo; followed by jump with rcx-relative offsets.
The relative jump function:
The first funclet just checks for the process being debugged, the &amp;ldquo;load_r9&amp;rdquo; funclet that jumps to the next funclet after skipping &amp;ldquo;n&amp;rdquo; bytes of garbage. Then the crackme calls a funclet &amp;ldquo;write_message&amp;rdquo; with the parameters (offset to &amp;ldquo;Why should I go out with you?</description>

      <description>Hi
This is my write up for the challange Cuba of CSAW CTF 2020 :
So this challenge is a CUBA program wrapped in a Windows Executable. CUBA is a GPU langage created by NVIDIA to work around GPU with high performance langage.
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html
Luckily there is a public SDK for it, with a disassembler :
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html
Using a tool called cuobjdump, we can extract the assembly code :
To extract ptx text from a host binary, use the following command: cuobjdump -ptx &amp;lt;host binary&amp;gt;  And after reversing the output, we can see that it&amp;rsquo;s a simple xor looping through a ciphered flag</description>
