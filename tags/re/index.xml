The files can be found there
For this challenge, we get an archive with a lot of files, the name of which seems to be a hash. Each file is an ELF x86_64 program file. In addition, a server listens, and requests:
Enter valid token to binary with name &amp;lt;8c235f89a8143a28a1d6067e959dd858&amp;gt; Token: at connection. We therefore understand quickly enough that we will have to automate the reversing of all these ELFs to send the correct token back to the server, and thus have the flag, the server requesting a series of tokens before spitting the flag.</description>

For this challenge, I first noticed (like in every other writeups) a big structure of offsets, that pointed to &amp;ldquo;funclets&amp;rdquo; followed by jump with rcx-relative offsets.
The relative jump function:
The first funclet just checks for the process being debugged, the &amp;ldquo;load_r9&amp;rdquo; funclet that jumps to the next funclet after skipping &amp;ldquo;n&amp;rdquo; bytes of garbage. Then the crackme calls a funclet &amp;ldquo;write_message&amp;rdquo; with the parameters (offset to &amp;ldquo;Why should I go out with you?</description>
