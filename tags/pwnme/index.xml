      <description>[pwnme 2023 - crypto] Scream Like Viking  Our protagonist John is in a room, he hears some kind of noise, like something resonating. But he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand it&amp;hellip; Perhaps he could play with his own echoes to guess what the meaning of this famous resonance could be&amp;hellip;

      <description>PwnMeIfYouKern was a linux kernel exploitation challenge from pwnme 2023.
There were no SMAP or SMEP, but KASLR was activated.
user@PwnMeIfYouKern:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep sm.p user@PwnMeIfYouKern:~$ cat /proc/cmdline console=ttyS0 loglevel=3 oops=panic panic=1 kaslr user@PwnMeIfYouKern:~$ cat /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr 4096 TL;DR  we manipulate elements from a linked list each element contains a buffer, his size, and a pointer to the next element of the list there is a buffer overflow, we can change the size of the buffer to leak data, and overwrite the pointer to the next element to get an arbitrary read/write break kaslr by leaking a pipe_buffer structure overwrite modprobe_path enjoy  Reverse engineering Here is the write function :</description>

      <description>chip8  Solves: 24 Easy
I just found a repo of a chip-8 emulator, it may be vulnerable but I didn&amp;rsquo;t had enough time to report the vulnerability with a working PoC. You must find a way to get the flag in memory on the remote service !

      <description>Heap-Hop  Solves: 31 Medium
Heap exploitation is cool, and the best is when no free is used. &amp;gt;Try to pwn the challenge and get the flag remotely.
Note:
 You must spawn an instance to solve this challenge. You can connect to it with netcat: nc IP PORT  Author: Express#8049

      <description>VIP at libc  Sooo I heard that if you were VIP, you could access some specific features! Maybe one of those features can be used to get inside their system?

 VIP at libc is a basic stack based buffer overflow challenge.</description>
