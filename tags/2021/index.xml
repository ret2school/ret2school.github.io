      <description>Collect green stuff, avoid red guys. Easy as pie, right? Not even your speedhacks will help you here! You might have to take a closer look and inspect it carefully. Have fun &amp;amp; good luck!
 This challenge is a game, according to its description. Since I gave up on the challenge I was trying to do (NOdeBANKing), I went to help other teammates blocked on this challenge.
This game was using Unity3D as engine, where game logic is usually written in C# or other language that compiles to MSIL.</description>

justpwnit justpwnit was a warmup pwn challenge. That&amp;rsquo;s only a basic stack overflow. The binary is statically linked and here is the checksec&amp;rsquo;s output:

      <description>DownUnderCTF - DUCTFnote (471 points) DUCTFnote was a heap exploitation challenge.
The main difficulty was that we could only have one active note at a time, so if we create a new note, the old one is no longer accessible.
Source code analysis I spotted one bug in the source code which leads to another bug :
135 void edit_note(datanote_t * note) { 136 if(!note) { 137 printf(&amp;#34;No Note.\n&amp;#34;); 138 return; 139 } 140 141 signed char idx = 0; 142 while(idx &amp;lt;= note-&amp;gt;size) { // note-&amp;gt;size can takes values from 0 to 127 (0x7f) 143 *(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) = fgetc(stdin); 144 if (*(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) == &amp;#39;\n&amp;#39;) {*(&amp;amp;(note-&amp;gt;data)+idx) = &amp;#39;\0&amp;#39;; break;} 145 idx++; 146 } 147 } In the function edit_note the condition of the while is incorrect and the loop is executed once too often : while(idx &amp;lt;= note-&amp;gt;size) should have been while(idx &amp;lt; note-&amp;gt;size).</description>

 Yay a heap challenge !
Setup The given libc didn&amp;rsquo;t have any symbols and no loader was provided, so I ran pwninit to retrieve a libc with symbols and a loader. Which I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise until me writing this, is that pwninit gave me a different libc, that changed the final part of the exploit : getting a shell !</description>

      <description>Welcome folks,
This writeup is about the Midnight Sun CTF frank challenge on how to recover a full RSA private key, when half of it is erased. Thanks to this recent cryptohack write-up from which this challenge is (for me) inspired. Challenge therefore requires recovering the entire RSA key from this image:
Get the part of the private key visible: The first step of the challenge is to recover the visible part, to do this I quickly created a small OCR script with the pytesseract module in Python, to facilitate the recovery task.</description>

We used the proximity browser in IDA with the &amp;ldquo;Add node -&amp;gt; Find path&amp;rdquo; mini-trick to get the path between the main and walk_end function. Once all the function names in the path where dumped, in the same order as in IDA, inside functions.txt, we just have to tell angr to discard, avoid, every state wherein the callstack is different from the path linking main and walk_end.</description>

      <description>RUN! (930 pts) This challenge was a keygenme for Windows (64-bit PE), and like all keygenmes you had to understand the algorithm and write a keygen for it.
The algorithm was &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo;, you just had to deal with C++ overhead for std::string, and was basically:
 The programs take the username and computes the sum of each char of the username (with some SSE2 wizardry) This sum is then given as seed to srand() The user serial is split into 2-char blocks, and each block is decoded as hex string and the integer is added to an array The program then searches the highest value in the decoded serial array and allocated a int array with this size The array is filled with rand() values mod 13371337 A valid serial is a sequences of indexes into the random array whose sum is equals to 0xbcdb6 mod 1337  So, the tricky part was to generate this sequence of indexes.</description>

 We are given the binary, the source code for it and the libc used on the server. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to find a vuln into the binary to get a shell and grab a flag from the server (typical pwn task).</description>

 Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m r0da.
Last day I did a CTF called BTSCTF, and a challenge called BtS emulator. As I&amp;rsquo;m still working on VMP virtualization currently, I&amp;rsquo;m kind good with VM stuff.
First I noticed that the binary has all its symbols in it, so easier to reverse. Then I saw that the dispatcher routine seems pretty clean.
We found the opcode related to it :</description>

Btw , the challenge description tell us that the flag should be located at / on the file system, this maybe mean that we have to get an access to the machine to read the flag.</description>

 With a mysterious &amp;ldquo;dump.7z&amp;rdquo; that contains a &amp;ldquo;dump&amp;rdquo; file. This file is an ELF binary, so we load it in IDA.

The challenge tells us that a ransomware encrypted the important homework and asks us to decrypt it.
Analyzing the Powershell While looking at the powershell, we can see an obfuscated Powershell command, which seems to split some random string and then evaluating it.

      <description>Hi
This is my write up for the challange Cuba of CSAW CTF 2020 :
So this challenge is a CUBA program wrapped in a Windows Executable. CUBA is a GPU langage created by NVIDIA to work around GPU with high performance langage.
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html
Luckily there is a public SDK for it, with a disassembler :
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html
Using a tool called cuobjdump, we can extract the assembly code :
To extract ptx text from a host binary, use the following command: cuobjdump -ptx &amp;lt;host binary&amp;gt;  And after reversing the output, we can see that it&amp;rsquo;s a simple xor looping through a ciphered flag</description>
