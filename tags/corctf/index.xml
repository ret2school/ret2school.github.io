      <description>Introduction zigzag is a zig heap challenge I did during the corCTF 2022 event. It was pretty exotic given we have to pwn a heap like challenge written in zig. It is not using the C allocator but instead it uses the GeneralPurposeAllocator, which makes the challenge even more interesting. Find the tasks here.
TL; DR  Understanding zig GeneralPurposeAllocator internals Hiijack the BucketHeader of a given bucket to get a write what were / read what where primitive.</description>

      <description>Introduction cshell2 is a heap challenge I did during the corCTF 2022 event. It was pretty classic so I will not describe a lot. If you begin with heap challenges, I advice you to read previous heap writeup.
TL; DR  Fill tcache. Heap overflow in edit on the bio field which allows to leak the address of the unsortedbin. Leak heap and defeat safe-linking to get an arbitrary write through tcache poisoning.</description>
